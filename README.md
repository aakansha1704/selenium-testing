# selenium-testing
A mini project containing all that I learned about different types of testing. 
<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>The test scripts contain ten test cases each for five pages from <b>https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/</b>. This was done using Selenium IDE. The code can also be run using Selenium Webdriver along with the pytest test framework.</p>

<h2>Types of testing</h2>
<p>There are four main categories of testing: <b>Acceptance Testing</b>, <b>Functional Testing</b>, <b>Performance Testing</b> and <b>Regression Testing</b>.</p>

<h3>Acceptance Testing</h3>
<p>Through acceptance testing, we can determine whether a system or a software meets the given requirements. This is important for ensuring the quality of the software. When a product is built, it should be able to meet a user's expectations. Hence, by testing we get to know how we can improve the experience.</p>
<h3>Functional Testing</h3>
<p>Functional testing is done to decide whether a system functions appropriately without issues. It checks the system at various levels to guarantee that all cases are secured and that the system does what it should do.</p>
<h3>Performance Testing</h3>
<p>This is done to check how a product works. It has two sub-categories: <b>Load testing</b> and <b>Stress testing</b>.</p>
    <h4>Load testing</h4>
    <p>To check performance when multiple users are connected.</p>
    <h4>Stress testing</h4>
    <p>This is a type of non-functional testing. It checks how well a product performs under maximum load on a particular task.</p>
<h3>Regression Testing</h3>
<p>Regression testing is done to check if a new feature hasn't caused new bugs in the code.</p>
